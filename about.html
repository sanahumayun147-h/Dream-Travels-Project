        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        
        <p>Dream Travels is a travel company committed to providing reliable, affordable, and hassle-free travel solutions. We specialize in airline ticketing, tour planning, hotel reservations, and visa assistance for both domestic and international travelers.

At Dream Travels, we turn your travel dreams into reality.</p>
        
            <h1>What we do?</h1>
            <p>We manage the complete travel process so our clients don't have to deal with multiple vendors, unclearing prices, or last-moment issues. Most travelers face the issues of unclear packages, hidden charges, poor coordination, and zero support once payment is made. We eliminate these problems by working on clear communication, fixed planning, and responsible execution. Our clients know their itinerary, costs, and arrangements before they travel-not during the trip.</p>
